# ESP32 Firebase Library 

## Features
This library has two advantages.
- Reduce the consumption of heap memory compare with well known library  
  (ex. [IOXhop_FirebaseESP32](https://github.com/ioxhop/IOXhop_FirebaseESP32)).
- Implements as 'singleton object (one of the GoF's design-pattern)' for safe access of resource.

Note: [ArduinoJson](https://arduinojson.org/) library will be needed to build and run example.
